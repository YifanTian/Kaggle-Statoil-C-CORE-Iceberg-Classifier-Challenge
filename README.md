# Kaggle-Statoil-C-CORE-Iceberg-Classifier-Challenge
My research resource and material for Kaggle Statoil/C-CORE Iceberg Classifier Challenge.

1. There are some basic prototype scripts.
2. The models folder contains the models(CNN) models that I learned from papers that I want to try.
3. I put relevant useful papers in this repo as well.
